    I did my undergrad at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA, and graduated with a B.S. in Statistics and Machine Learning and a minor in Business Administration. 

    Although I learned a lot, most of the school work was too theoretical for my liking. I wanted to work on things that were more practical and applicable in the real world. 

    I completed two data science internships while in school. One was at an e-commerce startup and one was at Goodyear Tire and Rubber company. 
                
    I learned the importance of good communication especially when working on an analytics team through those internships. 
                
    Your insights are only valuable if you get key decision makers to buy into your vision. That motivated me to dedicate a significant amount of time towards perfecting my communication and social skills.

    I started my full time career at IBM in their advanced analytics consulting sector. 
                
    I chose consulting because I wanted exposure to a wide variety of projects and teams, to travel around the world, and to sharpen my communication skills. IBM is known for their leadership in technical consulting, which is another reason why I chose to work there. 
                
    As expected, I worked on many different projects at IBM including inventory optimization, energy consumption forecasting, OCR software development, and sentiment analysis just to name a few. 
                 
    I've worn many hats such as being a data scientist, data engineer, MLOps engineer, project manager, solution architect, and account executive - each for months at a time. 
                
    I worked my way from an entry level consultant to a manager.
